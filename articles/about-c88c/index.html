    </header>
     <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>


<p>Data C88C, also cross-listed as CS C88 and originally offered as CS 88, provides a rigorous introduction to programming, abstraction, and the structure of programs. It is based on CS 61A and covers approximately 70% of the content of that course.</p>

<p>Data C88C is 3 units (rather than 4), has 2 lectures per week (rather than
3), has 2 hours of section per week (rather than 3), and has fewer total topics
and assignments than CS 61A. Both courses are great for learning about
programming. CS 61A moves faster. Students who take Data C88C and want to learn
the topics from CS 61A that were omitted can do so by taking CS 47A in a future
semester (or just studying on their own).</p>

<p>Note: during summer sessions, C88C has 4 lectures and 2 lab sections per week.</p>

<p>For the Data Science major and minor, the content in Data C88C is sufficient.
For the Computer Science major and minor, the additional content in CS 61A is
important. If you are certain that you want to major or minor in Computer
Science, CS 61A is the right introductory course.</p>

<p>Students who complete Data C88C can either proceed directly to CS 61B or
subsequently take CS 61A, a path that offers a substantial amount of review
because of the high topic overlap between the courses. (Review can be very
helpful for some students!) However, you cannot take Data C88C for credit after
having taken CS 61A.</p>

<p>In Data C88C, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how
to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques
for managing program complexity, such as functional programming and
object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>Data C88C primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular
language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to
the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source
language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the
diversity of its contributors.</p>

<p>Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of
taking this course. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in
your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the
concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new
programming language is but a few days' work. In fact, we'll learn a second language SQL near the end of the course.</p>

<p>A complete list of lecture topics, readings, and assignments appears in the
lecture schedule.</p>


<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>


<p>It is possible to take Data C88C without knowing or learning calculus. Knowledge
of calculus concepts will never be required to complete any assignments.
However, taking calculus is a great way to practice the arithmetic and algebra
that appear regularly in Data C88C.</p>

<p>There is no formal programming-related prerequisite for CS C88C because students
without prior experience can succeed in the course, but taking the
course without any prior programming experience is typically challenging.
Students who take the course without prior programming experience typically
must spend more time to complete assignments.</p>

<p>If you find it challenging to complete all of the required coursework in the
first three weeks, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you take another course first.
You'll likely have a better experience taking the course later. Taking the
course one semester later is unlikely to affect your degree progress or
otherwise put you behind, but continuing to struggle despite this recommendation
can lead to difficult academic circumstances that can affect your future
opportunities. It's better to finish the course with strong mastery of the
course material, even if that means delaying by a semester, than to rush through
it. At the very least, schedule plenty of time for the course.</p>


<h3 id="alternative-courses">Alternative Courses</h3>


<p>Here are some alternative UC Berkeley courses that are better suited for
students who do not have prior programming experience.</p>


<h4 id="cs-10">CS 10</h4>


<p><a href="http://cs10.org">CS 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> is an introductory
computer science course which is similar to Data C88C but is designed for students with no prior programming experience. CS 10 covers variables, functions, recursion, algorithmic complexity,
object-oriented programming, and many other relevant topics, with the
overall content overlap being about 60%. CS 10 starts the semester in Snap!, a
block-based programming language which allows students to focus on conceptual
understanding without worrying about unfamiliar syntax. After the midterm, the
course transitions into Python (the primary language Data C88C uses). CS 10 also
covers big ideas and social implications that go beyond programming, showing
you the beauty and joy of computing.</p>


<h4 id="data-8">Data 8</h4>


<p><a href="http://data8.org/">Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science</a> is an introduction
to data science designed to be accessible and useful for all Berkeley students.
This course was built for students without prior programming experience.  It
teaches students to program in Python, but covers a much smaller subset of
the language than this course. Most of the course focuses on data processing and
statistical techniques that are central to using computers to answer questions
about the world. Taking Data 8 before Data C88C is a good way to gain prior
programming experience, but taking CS 10 is a better way.</p>


<h4 id="info-206a">Info 206A</h4>


<p><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/206a">Info 206A: Introduction to Programming and
Computation</a> is a 2-unit
introduction to programming that overlaps with many topics in Data C88C. Professor Hany Farid has placed all of the <a href="https://farid.berkeley.edu/downloads/tutorials/learnPython/">videos and
exercises for this course
online</a>, and these
are an excellent resource to supplement Data C88C.</p>


<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>The course includes many events and opportunities for learning: lecture, lab,
office hours, and more. Try everything out to figure out what combination of
these course components help you the most.</p>


<h3 id="lectures-amp-videos">Lectures &amp; Videos</h3>


<p>There are two 50-minute live lectures per week (four per week during the summer). In addition, there is a video
playlist for each lecture. Please watch the video playlist before attending
live lecture or section. The videos cover all required content for the course.
Live lecture <strong>will not</strong> cover all course material and will focus on examples
(so watch the videos).</p>


<h3 id="lab">Lab</h3>


<p>Weekly lab sections include some review with your TA, a small-group discussion, and a programming-based lab assignment.</p>

<p>There are 10 lab points. Receiving credit for any 10 (or more) labs will earn a
perfect lab score for the course.</p>

<!-- (erickim) In Summer 2025, we only have a single lab format (online) -->
<!-- This semester, we are offering **two lab formats**: **regular lab**
and the **mega lab**. Both are designed to help students learn the course
material equally well. You can choose which format you want. Regardless of
the format you choose, all students **must complete and submit the lab assignment**
with all questions answered correctly to receive credit for lab.

Attendance for both formats is highly encouraged and will be recorded via Google Form,
but is ungraded. Thus, if you are sick or have the occasional conflict, you are free
to attend a different section or skip lab that week. However, students who are enrolled on
CalCentral for the lab section of their choice have seating priority.

#### Regular Lab

In regular lab, students work with each other to solve problems in person each week,
including the set of programming problems in each week's lab assignment.

#### Mega Lab

**Mega lab** students attend an online lab section over Zoom each week.
The Zoom meetings are **webcast** and **recorded**. You are
welcome to ask questions about lab assignments during course office hours. If
you need more support than that, you should switch to a regular lab.

#### Choosing a Section Format

Mega lab is only recommended for students with considerable prior programming
experience who are confident that they can succeed in the course without the
support of in-person lab.

Both options are meant to be great. Mega lab is designed to appeal to
students who learn well from watching videos, working independently, and
coming to drop-in office hours when they need help. But the smaller format of
regular labs has clear advantages for students who wish to work with others
and get to know the course staff. Most students choose regular lab. -->


<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>


<p>Office hours are drop-in tutoring sessions in which you can ask questions about
the material, receive guidance on assignments, and work with peers and course
staff in a small group setting. See the <a href="/office-hours">office hour schedule</a>
and come by.</p>


<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>


<p>In addition to programming-based lab assignments, there are programming-based
homework assignments and projects.</p>


<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>


<p>Homework assignments let you apply the concepts learned in lecture and
section to more challenging problems.
<!-- Homeworks will typically be released on Tuesdays and be due the following Wednesday. --></p>

<p><strong>Partial Credit</strong></p>

<p>Homework is scored out of 2 points, and every incorrect question reduces your
score by 1 point.</p>


<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>


<p>Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the course in
interesting ways.</p>

<p>You are allowed and encouraged to <a href="/su25/articles/pair-programming">pair program</a>
with a partner. Make sure to alternate roles so that both of you understand the
complete results. You may also work alone on all projects, although partners
are recommended.</p>

<p>Projects are graded on correctness, with points earned for each problem
successfully completed.</p>


<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>


<p>There will be two exams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The midterm will be held Tuesday July 15th 2025 from 3 PM - 5 PM PST.</li>
  <li>The final exam will be held Tuesday August 12th 2025 from 3 PM - 5 PM PST.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exams will be held online with Zoom proctoring.</p>

<!-- Exams will be taken on paper on campus in various rooms across campus.
There will be no remote exams offered this semester. -->

<!-- Students who are enrolled in another course with a conflicting final exam time
may take the Data C88C final exam in the next final exam slot: 3 pm - 6 pm on Tuesday
5/13. -->

<p>We will post an announcement on Ed ahead of each exam with information for
students who cannot take the exam.</p>


<h3 id="excused-exams-amp-incompletes">Excused Exams &amp; Incompletes</h3>


<p>Student who are unable to take the midterm for an approved reason may be <em>excused</em> from the exam. If you are unable to take the midterm, please email cs88@berkeley.edu <strong>before the exam</strong> to describe your situation. Reasons that may be approved include: illness, medical complications, travel, and course conflicts.</p>

<p>If a student is excused from the midterm exam, their exam score will be estimated via regression at the end of the course from their final exam score in a way that does not help or hurt their final grade on average. This method, which assigns them the average score on the missed exam among people who received the same or very similar scores on the final, takes into account variability in exam difficulty.</p>

<p>Typically, students will not be excused from the final exam. However, students who cannot take the final exam for an approved reason <strong>and</strong> who have completed the assignments for the course may request an incomplete by emailing cs88@berkeley.edu. Students who receive an incomplete grade can complete the course by taking the final exam of a future offering of Data C88C.</p>


<h2 id="accommodations-dsp-and-otherwise">Accommodations (DSP and Otherwise)</h2>


<p>We will provide appropriate accommodations to all students enrolled in
Berkeley's <a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu/">Disabled Students Program (DSP)</a>.
To ensure that you receive the appropriate accommodations, have your DSP
specialist submit a letter confirming your status and accommodations.</p>

<p>If you're not enrolled in DSP, or are in the process of being onboarded by DSP,
you may still be eligible for accommodations (such as extended time on exams or
extended deadlines). You may also be eligible for accommodations if serious
extenuating circumstances should come up during the semester. If you believe you
may require accommodations, please email cs88@berkeley.edu.</p>


<h3 id="assignment-extensions">Assignment Extensions</h3>


<p>If you need to request an extension, regardless of your DSP status, fill out
<a href="https://go.c88c.org/extensions">the extension request form</a>. Submissions to this form will be
visible only to the course instructors, and certain Student Support staff members.</p>

<p>Any extension request up to 24 hours will be approved. Any extension request
up to 3 days made by a student with a DSP accommodation for assignment
extensions will be approved. Any longer extensions require a strong
justification and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. There will
<em>never</em> be a penalty for requesting an extension.</p>


<h3 id="joining-late">Joining Late</h3>


<p>Work submitted late will not receive credit, even if it is from a student who
joined the course late. However, it is possible to submit assignments if you
are not enrolled. Therefore, if you would like to take the course but are
having enrollment issues, please submit all assignments by their due date.</p>

<p>To request to be added to course platforms so that you can submit, email
<a href="mailto:cs88@berkeley.edu">cs88@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>


<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>


<p>All DSP and accommodations-related materials for this course are kept in a
repository separate from the rest of the course materials that is visible only
to the instructors, selected staff, and staff course managers.</p>

<p>For any DSP and accommodations-related communications, please reach out to
<a href="mailto:cs88@berkeley.edu">cs88@berkeley.edu</a>, which will put you in touch
with our student support team. This inbox is only visible to staff members marked with
"cs88@" on the <a href="/su25/staff">staff page</a>. This inbox will be visible to future
members of course staff, so if you ever have a communication that you wish to
remain private, let us know and we can delete the email exchange once the
conversation is resolved.</p>


<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>



<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>


<p>The online textbook for the course is
<a href="https://www.composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>, which was created
specifically for this course, based on the classic textbook
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>.
Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule. We recommend that you
complete the readings before attending lecture.</p>

<p>Past exams appear on the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page.</p>


<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 200 points,
broken down as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The midterm, worth 50 points</li>
  <li>The final exam, worth 75 points</li>
  <li>Two projects, worth 45 points</li>
  <li>Homework, worth 20 points</li>
  <li>Lab, worth 10 points</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 extra credit points available to everyone for early submission of
projects.</p>

<p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores:</p>

<pre><code>             A  ≥ 185    A&#x2d;  ≥ 170
B+  ≥ 155    B  ≥ 140    B&#x2d;  ≥ 125
C+  ≥ 115    C  ≥ 105    C&#x2d;  ≥ 95
D+  ≥ 90     D  ≥ 85     D&#x2d;  ≥ 80</code></pre>

<p>Your final score will be rounded to the nearest integer before being converted
to a letter grade. 0.5 rounds up to 1, but 0.49 rounds down to 0.</p>

<p>The grade of A+ is assigned by discretion of the instructors.</p>

<p>There is no curve; your grade will depend only on how well you do, and not on
how well everyone else does. Score thresholds are based on how students
performed in previous semesters. Thresholds are not usually adjusted based
on student performance and never increased.</p>

<p>Incomplete grades will be granted only for medical or personal emergencies that
cause you to miss the final or last part of the course, only for students who
have completed the majority of the coursework, and only if work up to the point
of the emergency has been satisfactory. If you wish to discuss an incomplete
in the course, please contact <a href="mailto:cs88@berkeley.edu">cs88@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<p>There are 11 homework assignments (2 points each) but a maximum of 20 homework
points, so you can miss one homework and still have a perfect homework score.</p>


<h3 id="exam-recovery">Exam Recovery</h3>


<p>It is possible to recover lost points on the midterm by showing improvement on
the final. Your score for the midterm (as a percentage of the total points) will
be <strong>at least 90%</strong> of your score on the final exam. For example, a student who
scored 10/50 on the midterm (20%), but scored 37.5/75 (50%) on the final exam
would receive an adjusted midterm score of 50% * 90% = 22.5/50 points, and so
would recover 12.5 midterm points in addition to the 10 midterm points already
scored.</p>

<p><strong>Exam recovery only applies to students who take the final exam during finals week.</strong> Students who receive an incomplete are not eligible for exam recovery.</p>


<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>


<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time,
<a href="https://go.c88c.org/extensions">you can request an extension</a>. For late work beyond the extended deadline:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong> receive no credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework</strong> receives no credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Submissions within 48 hours after the deadline will receive
  75% of the earned score. Submissions that are 48 hours or more after the
  deadline will receive no credit.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="citizenship">Citizenship</h3>


<p>It is our expectation that all interactions with course staff and other
students will demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion
for others. Please remember to be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws
from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. For further reading, please
reference the <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community">Berkeley Principles of Community</a> and <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Code%20of%20Conduct_January%202016.pdf">Berkeley Campus Code of
Student Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>For exceptionally rude or disrespectful behavior toward the course staff or
other students, your final grade will be lowered by up to a full letter grade
(e.g., from an A- to a B-) at the discretion of the course instructors. You
don't need to be concerned about this policy if you treat other human beings
with even a bare minimum of respect and consideration and do not engage in
behavior that is actively harmful to others.</p>

<p>With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss course
activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will
learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask
questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Learning cooperatively is different from sharing answers. You shouldn't be
showing your code to other students or looking at others' code, except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>During lab, you can share all you want as long as you're all learning.</li>
  <li>For a project that allows partners, you can share anything with your partner.</li>
  <li>If you've finished a problem already, you can look at others' code to help
  them finish.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are helping another student, don't just tell them the answer; they will
learn very little and run into trouble on exams. Instead, try to guide them
toward discovering the solution on their own by thinking through examples.
Problem solving practice is critical to progress in computer science.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner informed. If
some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an
extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please
don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that
nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h3 id="academic-misconduct">Academic Misconduct</h3>


<p>Any students caught collaborating on exams will receive an F in the course.
Please don't be one of these students.</p>

<p>Reading others' homework or project solution to a problem before you solve that
problem on your own will incur point penalties. You are free to discuss
the problems with others beforehand, but you must write your own solutions. The
exception to this rule is that you may share code with your project partner.</p>

<p>The following is a list of things you should NOT do. This list is not
exhaustive, but covers most of the big offenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner.</li>
  <li>Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from you.</li>
  <li>Do not copy solutions from online sources such as Stack Overflow, Pastebin, and public repositories on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Do not read others' solutions to an assignment before you have completed the assignment</li>
  <li>Do not post your solutions publicly during or after the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a solution online, please report it to <a href="mailto:cs88@berkeley.edu">cs88@berkeley.edu</a>.
When we find an online solution, we ask the author to remove it. We also record the solution and use it
to check for copying. By reporting online solutions, you help keep the course
fair for everyone.</p>

<p>In summary, we expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and
complete projects with code written only by you and your partner.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in
this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the
time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy
any answers.</p>


<h4 id="chatgpt-ai-tools-and-the-internet">ChatGPT, AI Tools and The Internet</h4>


<p>While you may search for conceptual questions, e.g. "How do I add an item to a list in Python?" or "What does SyntaxError mean in Python?" <strong>you must not search for specific questions assigned in class under any circumstances.</strong> It is important to learn how to code, how to debug, and how to think like a programmer <em>independently</em>. Taking shortcuts to do your assignments will only hurt your ability to perform well on exams, which are done on paper without access to a computer or the internet. More importantly, it will hurt your ability to think critically in the real world.</p>

<p>This policy applies whether you're using ChatGPT, Google Search, or talking with your peers–which are all useful resources!</p>

<p>On your assignments you will be asked to cite what sources you consulted, similar to a research paper. (Though not so formally.) Code is like writing and ideas, it gets built up from many previous examples and ideas, and we should cite those.</p>

<p>Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of this course. We really just want you
to learn. The entire staff is very excited to be teaching Data C88C this semester
and we're looking forward to meeting such a large and enthusiastic group of
students. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to Data C88C!</p>
