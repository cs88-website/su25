     <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>


<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular
emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.</p>

<ol>
  <li>CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to
  think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level
  operations dictated by the computer hardware.</li>
  <li>CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as
  constructing and analyzing large programs.</li>
  <li>CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.</li>
</ol>

<p>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how
to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques
for managing program complexity, such as functional programming and
object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular
language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to
the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source
language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the
diversity of its contributors.</p>

<p>Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS
61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future
endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts
involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming
language is but a few days' work. In fact, you will be asked to learn at least
two other languages, Scheme and SQL, during the course.</p>

<p>A complete list of lecture topics, readings, and assignments appears in the
lecture schedule.</p>


<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>


<p>Math 1A is listed as a corequisite for CS 61A. That is, it may be taken
concurrently. Math 10A or Math 16A are also fine. It is possible to take CS 61A
without knowing or learning calculus. Knowledge of calculus concepts will never
be required to complete any assignments. However, taking calculus is a great
way to practice the arithmetic and algebra that appear regularly in CS 61A.</p>

<p>There is no formal programming-related prerequisite for CS 61A because students
without prior experience can succeed in the course, but taking the
course without any prior programming experience is typically quite challenging.
Students who take the course without prior programming experience typically
must spend more time to complete assignments and tend to receive lower
final grades in the course. Most CS 61A students have had significant prior
programming experience. A typical background includes at least one course
equivalent to CS 10 or a score of 3 or above on an AP Computer Science exam.
See the <a href="/articles/advice/">advice of former students</a> for more information on
this topic.</p>

<p>If you find it challenging to complete all of the required coursework in the
first three weeks, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you take another course
first. You'll likely have a better experience taking 61A later. Taking CS 61A
one semester later is unlikely to affect your degree progress or otherwise put
you behind, but continuing to struggle in CS 61A despite this recommendation
can lead to difficult academic circumstances that can affect your future
opportunities. It's better to finish CS 61A with strong mastery of the course
material, even if that means delaying by a semester, than to rush through it.</p>


<h3 id="alternative-courses">Alternative Courses</h3>


<p>Here are some alternative UC Berkeley courses that are better suited for
students who do not have prior programming experience.</p>


<h4 id="cs-10">CS 10</h4>


<p><a href="http://cs10.org">CS 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> is an introductory
computer science course which is similar to CS 61A but moves at a more moderate
pace. CS 10 covers variables, functions, recursion, algorithmic complexity,
object-oriented programming, and many other relevant CS 61A topics, with the
overall content overlap being about 50%. CS 10 starts the semester in Snap!, a
block-based programming language which allows students to focus on conceptual
understanding without worrying about unfamiliar syntax. After the midterm, the
course transitions into Python (the primary language 61A uses). CS 10 also
covers big ideas and social implications that go beyond programming, showing
you the beauty and joy of computing.</p>


<h4 id="data-8">Data 8</h4>


<p><a href="http://data8.org/">Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science</a> is an introduction
to data science designed to be accessible and useful for all Berkeley students.
This course was built for students without prior programming experience.  It
teaches students to program in Python, but covers a much smaller subset of
the language than CS 61A. Most of the course focuses on data processing and
statistical techniques that are central to using computers to answer questions
about the world. Taking Data 8 before 61A is a good way to gain prior
programming experience, but taking CS 10 is a better way.</p>


<h4 id="data-c88c-also-known-as-cs-88">Data C88C (also known as CS 88)</h4>


<p><a href="https://c88c.org/">Data C88C: Computational Structures in Data Science</a> is an
introduction to programming and computing that covers approximately 70% of the
content of CS 61A. Many of the same homework, lab, and discussion questions are
shared between these two courses.</p>

<p>Data C88C is 3 units (rather than 4), has 2 lectures per week (rather than
3), has 2 hours of section per week (rather than 3), and has fewer total topics
and assignments. Both courses are great for learning about programming. CS 61A
moves faster. Students who take Data C88C and want to learn the topics from CS
61A that were omitted can do so by taking CS 47A in a future semester (or just
studying on their own).</p>

<p>For the Data Science major and minor, the content in Data C88C is sufficient.
For the Computer Science major and minor, the additional content in CS 61A is
important. If you are certain that you want to major or minor in Computer
Science, CS 61A is the right introductory course.</p>

<p>Students who complete Data C88C can either proceed directly to CS 61B or
subsequently take CS 61A, a path that offers a substantial amount of review
because of the high topic overlap between the courses. (Review can be very
helpful for some students!) However, you cannot take Data C88C for credit after
having taken CS 61A.</p>


<h4 id="info-206a">Info 206A</h4>


<p><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/206a">Info 206A: Introduction to Programming and
Computation</a> is a 2-unit
introduction to programming that overlaps with many topics in the first eight
weeks of CS 61A. Professor Hany Farid has placed all of the <a href="https://farid.berkeley.edu/downloads/tutorials/learnPython/">videos and
exercises for this course
online</a>, and these
are an excellent resource to supplement CS 61A.</p>


<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>The course includes many events and opportunities for learning: lecture, lab,
discussion, office hours, and more. Try everything out to figure out what
combination of these course components help you the most.</p>


<h3 id="lectures-amp-videos">Lectures &amp; Videos</h3>


<p>There are four 80-minute synchronous online lectures per week. In addition, there is a video
playlist for each lecture. Please watch the video playlist before attending
synchronous lecture or section. The videos cover all required content for the course.
Synchronous lecture will be conducted as a problem-solving and question/answer session
based on the videos. Synchronous lecture <strong>will not</strong> cover all course material,
so watch the videos.</p>

<p>The synchronous online lecture will be recorded so that students
who are unable to attend the lecture can still see the problem-solving and question/answers.</p>


<h3 id="section">Section</h3>


<p>Weekly sections include a programming-based lab assignment and a discussion.</p>

<p>This semester, we are offering <strong>two section formats</strong>: <strong>regular sections</strong>
and the <strong>mega section</strong>.  Both are designed to help students learn the course
material equally well. You can choose which format you want.  It is possible to
change formats at certain points during the course that will be announced.</p>


<h4 id="regular-section">Regular Section</h4>


<p>Regular Sections meet four times a week in person with their section TA. Labs are Monday and Wednesday and discussions are Tuesday and Thursday.
Each Lab and Discussion section is 80 minutes. Attendance is required for students enrolled in a Regular Section.</p>

<p>In lab, students work with each other to solve a set of programming problems
in the lab assignment on a computer. To receive credit for lab section, you
<strong>must attend</strong> and get checked off (1 point), and you must submit and correctly
complete the lab assignment (1 point). You will be checked
off at the end of the lab period as long as you have made substantial progress
on the lab assignment. You can also be checked off and leave early if you
finish the lab assignment.</p>

<p>Lab accounts for 20 points of your grade.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Correctly completing and submitting Lab 0 is worth two points. There is no attendance point available for Lab 0, but you should still attend.</li>
  <li>Lab attendance is worth 9 points. You can earn a maximum of 9 attendance points for the 11 scored labs (Labs 1-11), which means that
  you can miss two required labs and still have a perfect attendance score.</li>
  <li>Lab correctness is worth 9 points. You can earn a maximum of 9 points for the 11 scored labs (Labs 1-11), which means that
  you can fail to correctly complete two required labs and still have a perfect lab correctness score.</li>
  <li>The last lab (lab 12) is optional, ungraded, and confers no credit.</li>
</ul>

<p>In discussion, students will work through a paper discussion worksheet individually
and in groups with guidance from the teaching assistant.
To receive credit for discussion section, you <strong>must attend</strong> and complete the attendance form.</p>

<p>You can earn a maximum of 10 discussion points across 12 required discussions, which means you can miss two and still have a perfect score.
Discussion 0 is optional and confers no point, but you should still attend.</p>

<p>Regular sections will not be webcast and are not recorded.</p>


<h4 id="mega-section">Mega Section</h4>


<p><strong>Mega section does not meet on a weekly basis</strong>. Instead, there are
videos released each week that cover the discussion topics.</p>

<p>Students in the mega section <strong>must complete</strong> and submit the weekly lab
assignment but are not expected to come to lab. You are welcome to ask questions
about lab assignments during course office hours. If you need more support than
that, you should switch to the regular section. All students in mega section will automatically
receive full credit for lab <em>attendance</em> credit but will be graded on lab <em>correctness</em>
based on the correctness of the submitted lab assignments.</p>

<p>Correctly completing and submitting Lab 0 is worth two points. You can earn a maximum of 9 points
for the 11 other scored labs (Labs 1-11), which means that you can fail to correctly complete two required
labs and still have a perfect lab correctness score.</p>

<p>All students in mega will automatically receive full discussion credit. It is
up to the mega section students to keep up with weekly videos and discussion
worksheets as they see fit.</p>


<h4 id="choosing-a-section-format">Choosing a Section Format</h4>


<p>Mega section is only recommended for students with considerable prior
programming experience who are confident that they can succeed in the course
without the support of in-person section.</p>

<p>Both options are meant to be great. Mega section is designed to appeal to
students who learn well from watching videos, working independently, and
coming to drop-in office hours when they need help. But the smaller format of
regular sections has clear advantages for students who wish to work with others
and get to know the course staff. Most students choose regular section.</p>


<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>


<p>Office hours are drop-in tutoring sessions where you can ask questions about
the material, receive guidance on assignments, and work with peers and course
staff in a small group setting. See the <a href="/office-hours">office hour schedule</a>
and come by.</p>


<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>


<p>In addition to programming-based lab assignments, there are programming-based
homework assignments and projects.</p>


<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>


<p>Weekly homework assignments let you apply the concepts learned in lecture and
section to more challenging problems. Homeworks will typically be released on
Thursday and be due the following Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>You are not allowed to use any artificial intelligence tools</strong> except for the
61A-bot integrated into ok. You are also not allowed to use solutions on the
internet. You will receive score penalties for doing so.</p>


<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>


<p>Each homework is scored out of 2 points, and every incorrect question reduces your
score by 1 point (up until 0). There are 7 homeworks and the maximum homework score for the course
is 12, so you can miss two homework <strong>points</strong> during the semester and still earn a
perfect homework score for the course.</p>


<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>


<p>Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the course in
interesting ways.</p>

<p>You are allowed and encouraged to <a href="/articles/pair-programming">pair program</a>
with a partner. Make sure to alternate roles so that both of you understand the
complete results. You may also work alone on all projects, although partners
are recommended.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to use any artificial intelligence tools to help you
complete projects. You are not even allowed to use AI tools that are available
for other parts of the course. It's important to learn how to build these
projects on your own. You are also not allowed to use solutions on the internet.</p>

<p>Projects are graded on correctness, with points earned for each problem
successfully completed.</p>


<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>


<p>There will be two exams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Midterm will be held 5-7 pm on Monday 7/14</li>
  <li>The Final will be held 11:30am-2:30pm on Tuesday 8/12</li>
</ul>

<p>Exams will be taken on paper on campus in designated exam rooms. There will be no remote exams this summer.</p>

<p>We will post an announcement on Ed ahead of each exam with information for
students who cannot take the exam.</p>

visible only to the course instructors, and certain Student Support staff members.</p>

<p>Any extension request up to 24 hours will be approved.  Any extension request
up to 3 days made by a student with a DSP accommodation for assignment
extensions will be approved. Any longer extensions require a strong
justification and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. There will
<em>never</em> be a penalty for requesting an extension.</p>


<h3 id="joining-cs-61a-late">Joining CS 61A Late</h3>


<p>Work submitted late will not receive credit, even if it is from a student who
joined the course late. However, it is possible to submit assignments if you
are not enrolled. Therefore, if you would like to take the course but are
having enrollment issues, please submit all assignments by their due date.</p>

<p>To request to be added to course platforms so that you can submit, email

<p>There are 4 extra credit points available to everyone for early submission of
projects. The staff may also make other extra credit opportunities available.</p>

<p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores:</p>

<pre><code>             A  ≥ 285    A&#x2d;  ≥ 270
B+  ≥ 255    B  ≥ 230    B&#x2d;  ≥ 210
C+  ≥ 190    C  ≥ 180    C&#x2d;  ≥ 175
D+  ≥ 170    D  ≥ 165    D&#x2d;  ≥ 160</code></pre>

<p>The grade of A+ will be assigned to students who perform exceptionally well
in the course at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p>Your final score will be rounded to the nearest integer before being converted
to a letter grade. 0.5 rounds up to 1, but 0.49 rounds down to 0.</p>

<p>There is no curve; your grade will depend only on how well you do, and not on
how well everyone else does. Score thresholds are based on how students
performed in previous semesters. Thresholds are not usually adjusted based
on student performance and never increased.</p>

<p>In a typical semester, 50-60% of students taking the course for a letter grade
will receive a B+ or higher.</p>

<p>Incomplete grades will be granted only for medical or personal emergencies that
cause you to miss the final or last part of the course, only for students who
have completed the majority of the coursework, and only if work up to the point
of the emergency has been satisfactory. If you wish to discuss an incomplete
in the course, please contact <a href="mailto:cs61a@berkeley.edu">cs61a@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Many students end the course with perfect homework, project, lab, and discussion
scores. These parts of the course are not meant to be evaluations, but instead
learning tools.</p>


<h3 id="exam-recovery">Exam Recovery</h3>


<p>It is possible to recover lost points on the midterm by showing improvement on the final. Your score for each midterm (as a percentage of the total points) will be at least 90% of your score on the final exam. For example, a student who scored 24/64 on the midterm, but scored 46/92 (50%) on the final exam would receive an adjusted midterm score of 50% * 90% = 28.8/64 points, and so would recover 4.8 midterm points in addition to the 24 midterm points already scored. i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>new_midterm_percentage = max(midterm_percentage, 0.9 * final_percentage)</code></pre>



<p>Exam recovery only applies to students who take the final exam during finals week. Students who receive an incomplete are not eligible for exam recovery.</p>


<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>


<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time,
<a href="/articles/about#assignment-extensions">you can request an extension</a>. For late work beyond the extended deadline:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong> receive no credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework</strong> receives no credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Submissions within 48 hours after the deadline will receive
  75% of the earned score. Submissions that are 48 hours or more after the
  deadline will receive no credit.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="citizenship">Citizenship</h3>


<p>It is our expectation that all interactions with course staff and other
students will demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion
for others. Please remember to be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws
from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. For further reading, please
reference the <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community">Berkeley Principles of Community</a> and <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Code%20of%20Conduct_January%202016.pdf">Berkeley Campus Code of
Student Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>For exceptionally rude or disrespectful behavior toward the course staff or
other students, your final grade will be lowered by up to a full letter grade
(e.g., from an A- to a B-) at the discretion of the course instructors. You
don't need to be concerned about this policy if you treat other human beings
with even a bare minimum of respect and consideration and do not engage in
behavior that is actively harmful to others.</p>


<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h2>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss course
activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will
learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask
questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Learning cooperatively is different from sharing answers. You shouldn't be
showing your code to other students or looking at others' code, except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>During lab, you can share all you want as long as you're all learning.</li>
  <li>For a project that allows partners, you can share anything with your partner.</li>
  <li>If you've finished a problem already, you can look at others' code to help
  them finish.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are helping another student, don't just tell them the answer; they will
learn very little and run into trouble on exams. Instead, try to guide them
toward discovering the solution on their own by thinking through examples.
Problem solving practice is critical to progress in computer science.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner informed. If
some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an
extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please
don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that
nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h3 id="academic-misconduct">Academic Misconduct</h3>


<p>Any students caught collaborating on exams will receive an F in the course.
Please don't be one of these students.</p>

<p>Reading others' homework or project solution to a problem before you solve that
problem on your own will incur point penalties. You are free to discuss
the problems with others beforehand, but you must write your own solutions. The
exception to this rule is that you may share code with your project partner.</p>

<p>The following is a list of things you should NOT do. This list is not
exhaustive, but covers most of the big offenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner.</li>
  <li>Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from you.</li>
  <li>Do not use AI tools such as Github Copilot or ChatGPT to fill in or correct your code.</li>
  <li>Do not copy solutions from online sources such as Stack Overflow, Pastebin,
  and public repositories on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Do not read others' solutions to an assignment before you have completed the
  assignment</li>
  <li>Do not post your solutions publicly during or after the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a solution online, please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/nL2yOj1Z81HcQYDi2">submit a link to that solution
anonymously</a>. When we find an online
solution, we ask the author to remove it. We also record the solution and use it
to check for copying. By reporting online solutions, you help keep the course
fair for everyone.</p>

<p>In summary, we expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and
complete projects with code written only by you and your partner.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in
this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the
time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy
any answers.</p>


<h2 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h2>


<p>Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of this course. We really just want you
to learn. The entire staff is very excited to be teaching CS 61A this semester
and we're looking forward to meeting such a large and enthusiastic group of
students. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to CS 61A!</p>
